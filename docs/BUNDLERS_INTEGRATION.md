# Bundlers Integration

## webpack

### Development

In order for webpack to pick up extracted CSS files, you need to setup [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) and [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader).

__css-loader__ will wrap the CSS into JS module, which will be used by __style-loader__ in browser to create a
`<style>` elements with extracted CSS.

To configure webpack to use __style-loader__ and __css-loader__ add the following snippet to your webpack config:
```js
/* rest of your config */
module: {
  /* rest of your module config */
  rules: [
    /* rest of your rules */
    {
      test: /\.css$/,
      use: [{ loader: 'style-loader' }, { loader: 'css-loader' }],
    },
  ],
},
```

For this case you can use `linaria/babel` preset without any options:

```diff
{
  "presets": [
    "env",
+   "linaria/babel"
  ]
}
```

### Production

For production, you don't want to have `<style>` elements created dynamically, you can either use `single` option and extract all CSS to a single file or use [ExtractTextWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin).

#### ExtractTextWebpackPlugin

In order to have your styles extracted with **ExtractTextWebpackPlugin**, you need to place the following snippet in your webpack production config:

```js
const ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  /* rest of your config */
  module: {
    /* rest of your module config */
    rules: [
      /* rest of your rules */
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({
          fallback: "style-loader",
          use: "css-loader"
        }),
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new ExtractTextPlugin("styles.css"),
  ],
};
```

This will extract the CSS from all files into a single `styles.css`. Then you need to include this file in your HTML file.

#### `single` option

For production environment, you need to use `single: true` options in conjunction with `filename` and `outDir` options:

```diff
{
  "presets": [
    "env",
    "linaria/babel"
- ]
+ ],
+ "env": {
+   "production": {
+     "presets": [
+       ["linaria/babel", {
+         "single": true,
+         "filename": "styles.css",
+         "outDir": "dist"
+       }]
+     ]
+   }
+ }
}
```

This will extract all styles into a single file `styles.css` inside `dist` directory.
Then you need to include this file in your HTML with `<link>` element:

```diff
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Linaria Example</title>
+   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/dist/bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
